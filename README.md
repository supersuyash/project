# Whatsapp Data analysis
I took data from my college friends group from Whatsapp. Cleaned it, add more features, such as  to evaluate more from data  `cursing` and `multi` which tells if text has some cursing and if the text was of some shared image/video/gif or link, and tried to make something good out of it.
## Motivation
I do not have a job and was getting bored. Then on reddit I saw someone sharing their insights on **r/dataisbeautiful**. So I gave a shot to make something beautiful out of trash we talk.
