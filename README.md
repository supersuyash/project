# Whatsapp Data analysis
I took data from my college friends group from Whatsapp. Cleaned it, add more features, such as  to evaluate more from data  `cursing` and `multi` which tells if text has some cursing and if the text was of some shared image/video/gif or link, and tried to make something good out of it. Final output is created using Tableau. It can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/suyash.gulati#!/vizhome/Thebillionairesclub/Story1)

## Motivation
I do not have a job and I was getting bored. Then on reddit I saw someone sharing their insights on **r/dataisbeautiful**. So I gave a shot to make something beautiful out of the trash we talk.

## Things that were asked
* Who speaks the most?
* Who has a dirty mouth?
* Who spams the most?
* When are we most active in a day?

       Just out of curiosity, I used gensim `word2vec` to create embedding. It gives a cool pattern. Code was taken from one of Siraj raval's video

## How to use?
This project was made in Jupyter Notebook and graphs were made using Tableau.
